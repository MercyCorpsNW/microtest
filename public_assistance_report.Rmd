title: "Logistic Regression Analysis of Public Assistance and Poverty Status from Microtest Data"
output: html_notebook
---

This analysis attempts to identify factors that lead to higher probability of an individual moving off of public assistance or to a higher income bracket.  The data is taken from Microtest and includes variables collected at intake and survey.  The variables at survey are used primarily to determine the value of the response, with the intake variables used as explanatories in the logistic regression model.  

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
